# Tracking-Intro

This is my initializing and beginner usage of both OpenCV and Mediapipe to track body movements. I use Mediapipe's built in functions to draw landmarks of the face, left hand, right hand, and body onto a camera which utilizes the OS' default video capturing device. This is a stepping stone for the next project where I will interpret human emotions using machine learning.
